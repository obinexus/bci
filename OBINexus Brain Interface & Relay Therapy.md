# OBINexus Brain Interface & Relay Therapy

# Framework

## Overview

The **OBINexus Brain Interface (BCI)** and **Relay Therapy System** is an open research and development
initiative designed to support communication and cognitive development for neurodivergent
individuals. The project prioritizes **non-invasive** and **ethically aligned** brain-computer technologies
that reinforce autonomy, safety, and accessibility.

The system builds on two key components: 1. **Directed Instruction Ontological BCI** – a non-invasive
brainwave interpretation framework focused on pre-conscious neural activity and pattern mapping. 2.
**Relay Therapy Protocol (Puppet Method)** – a communication and identity-building process enabling
non-verbal or minimally verbal individuals to express and strengthen internal states through guided
neural and sensory feedback.

## Mission

To create a humane, open-source platform that bridges neurological diversity and communication
technology through safe, transparent, and compassionate design.

We aim to: - Empower neurodivergent children and adults with tools for authentic self-expression. -
Enable caregivers and parents to participate safely in the communication development process. -
Provide researchers and clinicians with ethically guided interfaces for study and support.

## Core Principles

### 1. Non-Invasiveness First

All interfaces are designed using surface-level EEG technology and passive signal reading. No surgical
or semi-invasive procedures are permitted.

### 2. Sovereign Communication

Each user maintains complete ownership of their data, identity, and communication output.

### 3. Relay-Based Learning

The therapy model emphasizes gentle signal feedback ("relay") to help the brain recognize and
strengthen neural communication pathways naturally.

### 4. Ethical Framework

The project follows open governance, peer validation, and family-centered consent protocols in every
development phase.


## System Components

### 1. OBINexus BCI Layer

```
EEG-based neural data collection using dry electrodes.
Signal analysis via open-source models for pre-conscious wave detection (200–300ms pre-
awareness window).
Modular architecture supporting visual, auditory, and motor intention mapping.
```
### 2. Relay Therapy Protocol (RTP)

```
Uses non-verbal feedback mechanisms such as tactile puppets, visual loops, or rhythmic audio
to reinforce communication signals.
Adapts to each participant’s natural neural rhythm.
Encourages expression rather than correction.
```
### 3. Parental and Clinical Tools

```
Simple dashboards for observing neural response patterns.
Training materials for at-home or clinical use.
Encrypted data logging to ensure privacy and security.
```
## Roadmap

**Phase 1: Research & Documentation (Q1–Q2 2025)** - Publish initial theory and technical architecture. -
Create open EEG dataset for neurodivergent pattern mapping.

**Phase 2: Prototype Development (Q3–Q4 2025)** - Design open-source headset integration. -
Implement basic relay feedback protocols.

**Phase 3: Community Trials (2026)** - Collaborate with families, educators, and researchers. - Test ethical
consent, data control, and accessibility models.

**Phase 4: Formal Release (2027)** - Launch the full open-source platform. - Begin certification and
training programs for ethical BCI use.

## Intended Users

```
Parents of neurodivergent children seeking supportive, non-invasive communication tools.
Clinicians and therapists studying autism and neurodiversity communication.
Researchers developing EEG or cognitive interpretation models.
Developers contributing to open, safe BCI infrastructure.

**NeuroRights Initiative (2021)** ethical guidelines. - GDPR-compliant data protection and full local data
sovereignty.
